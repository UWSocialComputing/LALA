## Session Goals

* What were your goals with this wizard of oz session: what did you want to learn and measure?
    * The goal of this session was to run a simulated study session on Discord using Bot Prompts. Based on our initial research, we determined that users would like to be able to schedule and receive reminders for study sessions and have accountability measures throughout the session to keep themselves on track.
    * We wanted to learn how the participants’ behavior either validated or challenged these assumptions to help further our design and implementation. So, we took careful notes and asked follow-up questions to gauge specific points that were interesting to our implementation and design decisions, including what features they hoped to see in our tool.

## Findings from Session

* What did you learn in the wizard of oz session?
    * Users questioned the bot’s behavior and helpfulness for the rating system for specific prompts. The study group indicated interest in a feature that would  collect data analytics from these ratings that would be communicated after the study session for students to examine their study habits and productivity in different settings.
    * We also learned that the quality of the study session (measured by the self-reported rating) is greatly affected by the social behaviors that are demonstrated in the session. One user noted that they often get distracted in group study sessions that they currently participate in, but gave low ratings because they went through the simulated session alone. 

* Are the findings promising enough that you would like to go ahead with the project? (If yes, describe why, if no, describe what changes you are proposing to make.)
    * We believe that our findings are promising enough that we would like to go ahead with the project. Our user testing showed that users enjoyed the ease of scheduling group study sessions with our bot. Additionally, they enjoyed that it functioned as a reminder to keep each other accountable.  Since many people use discord for classes already, the transition of integrating the bot would also be minimal. 

* What elements will you keep in your next iteration of the design?
    * Based on the user feedback we plan on keeping scheduling as a primary function of the bot as our participants specifically notes they enjoyed this feature. 

* What elements do you need to revise? Why?
    * We also plan on keeping session goals, recommendations, and ratings, but are exploring the idea of implementing analytics and new reactions to algin with these based on feedback we got from our follow up questions. For session recommendations we gathered that users would like more guidance when it comes to these beyond a message. For ratings our participants wanted to know what tget would be used for and were interested in the idea of analytics and comparing across study sessions, so this is something we may use to inform future design decisions.
