_Project Pitch Solution Directions_

## Solution Direction: Task and Time Management

 * Combining to-do lists with calendar platforms (most likely Google Calendar)
    * Ability to “drop in” tasks and corresponding due dates to the tool
    * Alert the user to assignments due within 3-7 days (helps time management)
    * Ability to schedule work times and break times


 * Integration with class platforms (class websites, Canvas calendars, etc.)
    * Going from 2+ platforms per class → one for all classes
    * Integrate accommodations scheduling (for tests, assignments, etc.)


 * Analytics tracking
    * Automatically keep track of activities you did on your calendar
    * Presents a visualization of how you spent your time


## Solution Direction: Community Focus with Discord

* Integrate personal calendar with Discord
    * Discord now commonly used for classes
    * Server-wide reminders of class assignments + due dates

 * Create more opportunities for collaboration + socialization
    * Study sessions/progress check-ins based on upcoming due dates
    * Simplify process of casually scheduling with others
    * Additional status updates (studying, study break, etc) to match you with someone who is doing the same thing


 * Gamification
    * Habit tracking: see what habits others are working on and their progress
    * Have badges/awards for time spent studying, task completion, etc
